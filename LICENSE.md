Background
~~~~~~~~~~
I love this microprocessor. It was at the heart of two of my favourite
machines, the BBC Micro, and the Nintendo Entertainment System, as well
as countless others in that era. I learnt to program on the Model B, and
I learnt to love games on the NES, so in many ways, this processor is
why I am the way I am today.
In February 2019, I decided to undertake a selfish personal project and
build a NES emulator. Ive always wanted to, and as such I've avoided
looking at source code for such things. This made making this a real
personal challenge. I know its been done countless times, and very likely
in far more clever and accurate ways than mine, but I'm proud of this.
